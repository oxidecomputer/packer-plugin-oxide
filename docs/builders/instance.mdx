  The oxide-instance builder creates custom images for use with Oxide. The builder
  launches a temporary instance from an existing source image, connects to the
  instance using its external IP, provisions the instance, and then creates a new
  image from the instance's boot disk. The resulting image can be used to launch
  new instances on Oxide.

# Oxide Instance - Builder

Type: `oxide-instance`

@include 'component/builder/instance/Builder.mdx'

## Configuration

@include 'component/builder/instance/Config.mdx'

### Required

@include 'component/builder/instance/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional

@include 'component/builder/instance/Config-not-required.mdx'

## Communicator

A [`communicator`](/docs/communicators) can be configured for the builder.

### SSH

The builder automatically generates a temporary SSH key pair that's used to
connect to the temporary instance unless one of the following SSH communicator
attributes are set.

- [`ssh_password`](/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_password)
- [`ssh_private_key_file`](/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_private_key_file)
- [`ssh_agent_auth`](/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_agent_auth)

The temporary SSH public key is uploaded to Oxide, injected into the emphemeral
instance, and deleted during cleanup. The temporary SSH private key is used by
Packer to connect to the instance.

The name of the temporary SSH public key uploaded to Oxide can be set using the
[`temporary_key_pair_name`](/docs/communicators/ssh#temporary_key_pair_name)
attribute. Generally there's no reason to set this but it's available should it
be necessary.

## Provisioner

A [`provisioner`](/docs/provisioners) can be configured for the builder.

### File System Consistency

In [oxidecomputer/packer-plugin-oxide#33](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/packer-plugin-oxide/issues/33) 
it was reported that images built by the builder were missing files uploaded
during provisioning. To prevent missing files add a provisioner that forces the
instance to flush any buffered data to its storage devices. This provisioner
must be defined after all other provisioners that modify the file system.

A provisioner that reboots the instance will work. Packer will attempt to
connect to the instance once it's back up.

```hcl
# Linux. 
provisioner "shell" {
  # Required so Packer doesn't error when the SSH connection terminates.
  expect_disconnect = true
  inline = [
    "sudo reboot",
  ]
}

# Windows.
provisioner "windows-restart" {}
```

A provisioner that explictly forces a file synchronize will work.

```hcl
# Linux. 
provisioner "shell" {
  inline = [
    "sudo sync",
  ]
}

# Windows.
provisioner "powershell" {
  inline = [
    "Get-Volume | Write-VolumeCache"
  ]
}
```

## Examples

This example uses environment variables for Oxide credentials and uses
the automatically generated SSH key pair to connect to the instance for
provisioning. The provisioners shown demonstrate common patterns when working
with the builder.

```hcl
source "oxide-instance" "example" {
  project            = "packer-acc-test"
  boot_disk_image_id = "feb2c8ee-5a1d-4d66-beeb-289b860561bf"

  # SSH communicator configuration.
  ssh_username = "ubuntu"
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.oxide-instance.example",
  ]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates",
    ]
  }

  # Packer recommends using a 2-step workflow for uploading files.

  # 1) Upload the file to a location the provisioning user has access to.
  provisioner "file" {
    content     = "Hello from Packer!"
    destination = "/tmp/hello.txt"
  }

  # 2) Use the shell provisioner to move the files and set permissions.
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "sudo cp /tmp/hello.txt /opt/hello.txt",
      "sudo chmod 0644 /opt/hello.txt",
    ]
  }

  # Reboot the instance to flush any buffered data to its storage devices.
  #
  # https://github.com/oxidecomputer/packer-plugin-oxide/issues/33
  provisioner "shell" {
    # Required so Packer doesn't error when the SSH connection terminates.
    expect_disconnect = true
    inline = [
      "sudo reboot",
    ]
  }
}
```
