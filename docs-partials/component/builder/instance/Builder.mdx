The `oxide-instance` builder creates custom images for use with [Oxide](https://oxide.computer).
The builder launches a temporary instance from an existing source image, connects to the instance
using its external IP, provisions the instance, and then creates a new image from the instance's
boot disk. The resulting image can be used to launch new instances on Oxide.

The builder does not manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.
